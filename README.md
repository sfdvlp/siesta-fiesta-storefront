## Development

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root dir with the following contents:
   ```.env
   VENDURE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/shop-api
   # or
   # VENDURE_API_URL=https://readonlydemo.vendure.io/shop-api
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```
4. `npm run dev` - run the storefront with a local Remix server
5. `npm run dev:cf` - runs locally with the Cloudflare Pages configuration

### Vendure Server 

This storefront requires a Vendure server. You can either run a local instance, or use our public demo server.

#### Code Generation

Whenever the Graphql documents (the constants using the `gql` tag) in the [./app/providers](./app/providers) dir changes,
you should run `npm run generate` to generate new sdk definitions.

#### Local

You can set up a local instance, populated with test data by following the instructions in the Vendure [Getting Started guide](https://www.vendure.io/docs/getting-started/). Note that since Remix runs on port 3000 by default, you should change the local Vendure server to run on another port, and also make sure you have enabled the `bearer` method for managing session tokens:

```ts
// vendure-config.ts
export const config: VendureConfig = {
  apiOptions: {
    port: 3001,
    // ...
  },
  authOptions: {
    tokenMethod: ['bearer', 'cookie'], // or just 'bearer'
    // ...
  },
  // ...
};
```

## Stripe integration

This repo has a built-in Stripe payment integration. To enable it, ensure that your Vendure server is set up with 
the [StripePlugin](https://www.vendure.io/docs/typescript-api/payments-plugin/stripe-plugin/).

Ensure your new PaymentMethod uses the word `stripe` somewhere in its code, as that's how this integration will know
to load the Stripe payment element.

Then add your Stripe publishable key to the env file:

```
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_t38hl...etc
```

### Public demo

There is a publicly-available demo instance at https://readonlydemo.vendure.io/shop-api

## Deployment

This repo is configured to deploy to either Netlify or Cloudflare Pages.

No special setup should be needed, as the [remix.config.js](./remix.config.js) file contains a check for the `process.env.CF_PAGES` environment variable to determine whether to use the Cloudflare Pages or Netlify server configuration.

Follow the usual procedure for setting up a project in Netlify/CF Pages and point it to your clone of this repo on GitHub/Gitlab.
